<h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>

<h2>Margin.</h2> 
  <p>Controls how much breathing room or whitespace that exists outside of a box.
    The margin property sets the margins for an element, and is a shorthand property for the following properties:
    margin-top,margin-right,margin-bottom and margin-left. In that order.

  <body>
   <h3>Border</h3>

  
  
  <p class="paragraph"> A border is a visual element that surrounds an HTML element and adds a decorative effect to it. 
    It can be used to create emphasis, to separate elements, or to group elements together.
    In HTML, you can add a border to an element by using the border attribute. This attribute allows you to specify the width, style, and color of the border.</p>

     <h4>Padding</h4>

     <p class="paragraph">In HTML and CSS, padding refers to the space between an element's content and its border.
       Padding can be used to create space between the element's content and its border, 
       which can help to separate the content from other elements on the page and improve the overall visual design.

      In CSS, padding can be set using the padding property, which takes values for the top, right, bottom, and left sides of the element,
       or using the shorthand padding property, which takes one value to set the padding for all four sides,
        or up to four values to set the padding for each side individually.</p></body>
