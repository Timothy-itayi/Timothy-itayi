          <h1 class="heading">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>

          <p class="paragraph"> My long term goal is to one day develop video games for my favourite sim racing companies like 
          (I.e polyphony, who have made the highly celebrated Grand Torismo</p>

          <h1 class="heading">Description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>

          <p class="paragraph">My strengths generally come from my ability to push through a lot of work without stopping.
             If I have eaten that is. 
             If I eat a medium to large sized  meal in the morning I can stay pretty much wired in for the remainder of the day.
              However there is a caveat to this which is I can get lost in the work so much and when I get stuck I have reached my limits and no longer continue.</p>

<h1 class="heading">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h1>

<p class="paragraph">To ask for help a lot sooner instead of trying to figure it out for too long</p>

<h1 class="heading">How you will manage your workload in this programme?
    explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives?</h1>

    <p class="paragraph">The way I would go about managing my workload would be to make sure that I ask questions and communicate how I am feeling about the work. 
        I do think itâ€™s important to have a steady stream of communication with not just your cohort but your facilitator about the work.
         And to know that they are right there with you to help you push through the heavy load. </p>

         <h1 class="heading">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h1>

         <p class="paragraph">Take a deep breath.
             Remove yourself from the device and do something unrelated to the work. </p>

             <h1 class="heading">How and where  you will  seek help in a timely way and I expect from my Facilitation team?</h1>

             <p class="paragraph">Well for starters I would seek help through the provided channels given like Discord and soon to be Slack and I Expect my facilitation team to hopefully be there when I need.
                 So far during my experience in Sprint 2 I have been met with kind and generous replies from everyone.</p>
