            Hello and welcome to my web development journey. My name is Timothy Tawanda Itayi. I am originally from Zimbabwe
            but moved to Auckland, New Zealand when I was around 9 years old. Throughout my life, I have always been interested
            in web development and everything it has to offer, but I was often distracted by other ventures.

            I used to be a 2D animator, creating fight choreography videos from my favorite anime and Anime music videos I found on YouTube.
            I also dabbled in photography through my then girlfriend, which led me to try modeling for a bit (mainly with young photographers on Instagram).
            After a while, I ventured into the entertainment industry. One of the projects I'm proud of is a play I participated in back in 2019 in Dunedin called "The Flick."

            Since then, I got back into art, mainly charcoal and graphite drawing. I'm planning to explore oil paints in the near future.
            Here are some of my most recent works. I'll update the blog with more soon.
