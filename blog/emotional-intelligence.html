     <p class="paragraph">
        Emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive, interpret, demonstrate, control, evaluate, and use
        emotions to communicate with and relate to others effectively and constructively.
        This ability to express and control emotions is essential, but so is the ability to understand, interpret, and respond to the emotions 
        of others.

     <h1 class="header">How is EQ different to IQ? & Why is EQ important?</h1>

     <p class="paragraph">
        IQ is used to determine academic abilities and identify individuals with off-the-chart intelligence or mental challenges. 
        EQ is a better indicator of success in the workplace and is used to identify leaders, good team players, and people who best work by themselves.

        There are differing perspectives on whether EQ or IQ is more important.
        Those in the EQ camp say "A high IQ will get you through school, a high EQ will get you through life."
