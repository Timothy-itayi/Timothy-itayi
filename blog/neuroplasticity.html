    <h1 class="text-2xl bg-blue-100 font-bold">What is Neuroplasticity?</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity, or brain plasticity, is the ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganization.
        It is when the brain is rewired to function in some way that differs from how it previously functioned.
        These changes range from individual neuron pathways making new connections, to systematic adjustments like cortical remapping.
        Examples of neuroplasticity include circuit and network changes that result from learning a new ability, environmental influences, practice, and psychological stress.

    <h1 class="text-2xl bg-blue-100 font-bold">How is neuroplasticity relevant to learning?</h1>
    <img src="/assets/brain.png" alt="image" class="mb-4">
    <p class="mb-4">
        Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to new experiences, including learning.
        It means that the structure and function of neurons and synapses can be modified, allowing for the formation of new neural connections and the strengthening of existing ones.
        This enables the brain to learn new information and skills, and to store memories. Thus, neuroplasticity is a key factor in the brain's ability to learn and adapt.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl bg-blue-100 font-bold">How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Understanding neuroplasticity can have numerous benefits for people such as recognizing the importance of engaging in activities that promote brain health, such as physical exercise, cognitive stimulation, and social interaction.
        Improved learning and memory: Knowing how the brain changes with experience can help individuals develop effective strategies for learning and retaining new information.

    <h1 class="text-2xl bg-blue-100 font-bold">What is a growth mindset?</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Growth mindset is a concept in psychology that refers to the belief that one's abilities, intelligence, and talents can be developed and improved through hard work, effort, and dedication.
        People with a growth mindset believe that their abilities are not fixed, but can be developed and enhanced over time.
        In contrast, people with a fixed mindset believe that their abilities and talents are set in stone and cannot be changed. They often avoid challenges and are less likely to persevere in the face of difficulty, as they believe that success is based solely on innate talent.
        Research has shown that having a growth mindset can have several positive outcomes, including increased motivation, better performance, increased resilience, and improved relationships.
