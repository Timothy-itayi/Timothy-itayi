    <h1 class="text-2xl bg-blue-300 font-bold mb-4">What is a DOM</h1>
    <p class="mb-6">
        The DOM or 'Document Object Model' is a programming API for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-2xl bg-blue-300 font-bold mb-4">How does the DOM relate to CSS and HTML?</h1>
    <p class="mb-6">
        Using the DOM in CSS is not limited to classes or ids that you create. You can use any element to walk through the document - any HTML tag in fact.
        Let's say I want to make "My can of beer" bold. I don't actually need to change the document at all.
        Using the DOM tree, I can specify a rule that will make the text bold.
    </p>
   
    <img src="/assets/getElementById()Method.png" alt="image" class="mb-6">
    <p class="mb-6">
        The easiest way to access a single element in the DOM is by its unique ID. You can get 
        an element by ID with the getElementById() method of the document object.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-2xl bg-blue-300 font-bold mb-4">Events and its relation to the DOM</h1>
    <p class="mb-6">
        Events are signals fired inside the browser window that notify of changes in the browser or operating system environment.
        Programmers can create event handler code that will run when an event fires, allowing web pages to respond appropriately to change.
        These 'Events' can range from Animation, Composition, Gestures, Inputs, and Media to name a few. :)
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/event objects relating to the dom.png" alt="image" class="mb-6">
    <p class="mb-6">
        DOM Events allow JavaScript to add an event listener or event handlers to HTML elements.
        The way to set an event handler on an element is to use the EventTarget.addEventListener() Method.
        This approach allows multiple listeners to be assigned to an element, and for listeners to be removed if needed.
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-2xl bg-blue-300 font-bold mb-4">HTML DOM FORM SUBMIT METHOD()</h1>
    <p class="mb-6">
        The HTML DOM Form submit() method is used for submitting the form data to the address specified by the action attribute.
        It acts as a submit button to submit form data and it doesn't take any kind of parameters.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/Dom Form submit() method.png" alt="image" class="mb-4">
    <p class="mb-6">
        Example code for the Form Submit() method:

    <h1 class="text-2xl bg-blue-300 font-bold mb-4">An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h1>
    <p class="mb-6">
        Letâ€™s imagine that you are in charge of planning the layout of a new neighborhood in the city.
        This neighborhood will have some residential buildings, some eateries, a bank branch and a mall.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/java analogy .png" alt="image" class="mb-4">
    <p class="mb-6">
        The structure of the building itself.
        The interior and exterior decoration of the building.
        The actual functions that visitors can perform in each building.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/dom analogy .png" alt="image" class="mb-4">
    <img src="/assets/dom analogy 2.png" alt="image" class="mb-6">
    <p class="mb-6">
      Since each of these three languages serves a different purpose, web developers generally use separate files for each one.
      This idea is called "separation of concerns" - each file should have a different function within the site as a whole.
      Although you could technically include all the code in one HTML file, that will eventually lead to repetitive code
      as you grow your site.
  </p>
  
  <h1 class="text-2xl bg-blue-300 font-bold mb-4">What is control flow and loops?</h1>
  
  <p class="mb-6">
      Control flow statements let you control the flow of the execution of the code in your program. In JavaScript programming
      you can control the flow of execution of the code by placing the decision making, branching, looping and adding conditional blocks.
  </p>
  <img src="/assets/analogy flow.png" alt="image" class="mb-4">
  <p class="mb-6">
      Once it is determined whether a condition is True or False the program knows what actions to take
      and will then continue on to the next condition to repeat the process. An analogy to control flow is
      akin to traffic management... The determine the order in which cars are allowed to drive at every moment.
  </p>
  <img src="/assets/control flow.png" alt="image" class="mb-6">
  
  <p class="mb-6">
      Generally we use decision-making statements when we have to decide which block of the code will be executed.
      There are 3 types of decision-making statements.
  </p>
  <div class="mb-4">
      If statement:
      <img src="/assets/if statements.png" alt="image" class="mb-2">
      <p class="mb-4">
          The if statement is the most basic decision-making statement in the JavaScript programming language.
          There are two possible values of the condition, i.e., true and false.
          The code block after the if statement will execute only if the value of the condition statement is true.
          If the value of the condition statement is false, the code block will not be executed.
      </p>
  </div>
  
  <img src="/assets/if statement 2.png" alt="image" class="mb-6">
  
  <div class="mb-4">
      The if else statement is somewhat similar to the if statement; we are just adding an extra block of code
      after the if statement. If the value of the condition statement is true, the if block will be executed, else
      the else block will be executed.
  </div>
  <img src="/assets/switch example.png" alt="image" class="mb-6">
  
  <p class="mb-6">
      The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
      The way it works is as follows: The switch expression is evaluated once.
      The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
      If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
      If there is no match, the default code block is executed.
  </p>
  
  <h1 class="text-2xl bg-blue-300 font-bold mb-4">LOOPS WHAT ARE THEY?</h1>
  
  <p class="mb-6">
      In programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
      Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked,
      such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.
  </p>
  <img src="/assets/for loops.png" alt="image" class="mb-4">
  <p class="mb-6">
      In the for loop, we are going to check the value of the condition statement.
      If the value is true, the block of the code will be executed.
      After the successful execution of the code block, control goes to the condition statement. Now, if the value is true, again
      the block of the code will be executed.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mb-6">
      A real-world example of a loop would be software of the ATM machine.
      The ATM machine is in a loop to process transactions until you acknowledge that you have no more to do.
  </p>
  <h1 class="text-2xl bg-blue-300 font-bold mb-4">The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h1>
  
  <p class="mb-6">
      Objects, for starters, are used to represent a "thing" in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book,
      a character in a game. Basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. In objects,
      these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value.
  </p>
  <div class="mb-4">
      There are 3 ways to access data in an object:
      <img src="/assets/object.property.png" alt="image" class="mb-2">
      <img src="/assets/[].object.png" alt="image" class="mb-2">
      <img src="/assets/const{object}.png" alt="image" class="mb-2">
  </div>
  <p class="mb-6">
      An array, on the other hand, is used whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable.
      Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list.
      The way you would access data in an array is by referring to its index number. The index arrays start with [0], meaning the first element has index [0] and the second has [1].
  </p>
  
  <h1 class="text-2xl bg-blue-300 font-bold mb-4">What are functions and why are they helpful?</h1>
  
  <p class="mb-6">
      A Function is simply a "chunk" of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times.
  </p>
  <img src="/assets/function.png" alt="image" class="mb-4">
  
  <p class="mb-6">
      Functions are helpful because they enable programmers to break down or decompose a problem into smaller chunks,
      each of which performs a particular task. Once a programmer defines a function, they can then call it whenever they need it, simply using its name.
      However, in order to work, the function will probably require some inputs or parameters, which are given to the function each time it is called.
