    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Blocked on a simple problem</h1>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        I am going to be as honest as possible with the following problem. JavaScript as a whole has been quite difficult 
        to wrap my head around. I will refer to Sprint-3 on JavaScript cafe as an example because it was quite a simple problem that I just could not get my head around. 
        We had to essentially make an app that hosted food and beverage options for people to choose from. 
        In order to generate an order, it was required from us to be able to write code that would allow us to generate a random order within the 
        parameters set. So for example, if the menu had 4 items in it, the button named 'Generate Order' would be called and theoretically a random
        order of said menu items would be returned. However, I could not for the life of me understand why the `GetRandomInt()` function would not work. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What problem-solving technique did I use?</h1> 
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        The first thing I did to help me with this issue was ask for help. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.... But I waited far too long to do it.
        Luckily for me, in the #Foundations Discord channel I found out about a JavaScript Q & A that was being held by one of the Facilitators. So I took it 
        upon myself to ask 'Gerard' if he could steer me in the right direction, and sure enough he did. 
        'Gerard' had informed me that the reason the `GetRandomInt()` function would not work was because it was not defined. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Solving the Problem Elegantly</h1>
    <p class="mb-6">
        After getting the advice I needed to solve the problem, I soon realized that I needed to remember how to define a variable in order for the function to take place. 
        So I used the following code to define a variable for the function to take place. I learned that revision is important, especially in this field when there can be
        so many different things to remember. You can get lost learning new things every single day that you forget to think about how each and every little thing you have learned has 
        some kind of significance to the next thing. However, sometimes it is so difficult to remember not just what something is but how it is written. This is called a language for a reason
        and now I understand why. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How confident am I using other Problem-Solving Techniques?</h1>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
        My rule of thumb: The most important thing to do is to make the problem easier. 
        Pseudocode helps to a degree, however I do think I read into it too much and get lost in it. My confidence for that is on the wavy side. 
        Trying something, every chance that I can get. It usually fails but at least I tried. 
        Rubber ducky method: I usually find this method irritating and unhelpful. 
        Reading error messages: Now this is something I actually don't mind. I am pretty confident with reading error messages and not freaking out. 
        Console.logging: There are plugins that are far superior to console.logging a problem to solve. 
        Googling: Love this... Highly recommend.
        Asking your peers for help: Same with googling, I can't stress enough how much I am grateful to have people in my life who are in the tech world who can help. 
        Asking coaches for help: Same as previous.
        Improving your process with reflection: My process improves more when I am doing the tasks and then revising more on understanding the problem in a different way. I have found the reflection process portion to be distracting. My brain just doesn't do it for me.
